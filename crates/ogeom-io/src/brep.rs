//! The `.brep` interchange text format, both directions.
//!
//! An interchange format for boundary representation that a good deal of the
//! field can already read, implemented here from its published
//! specification. It is worth having for one reason: it is the cheapest
//! bridge that exists for an application moving onto this kernel, far
//! cheaper than STEP to produce and far more faithful than a mesh.
//!
//! The file is five sections — a header, a table of placements, a table of
//! geometry, and a table of topology — and the last of those is the
//! interesting one. Topology records are written leaves first and *numbered
//! backwards*: the final record is number one, and a record refers to its
//! children by how far above it they sit. So a parent can only name children
//! already written, the file needs no forward references, and a reader can
//! build the model in a single pass with nothing left dangling.
//!
//! ## What crosses
//!
//! Everything this kernel's own geometry can say: lines, circles, ellipses,
//! parabolas, hyperbolas, B-splines, and the trimmed and offset forms over
//! them, in two dimensions and three; planes, cylinders, cones, spheres,
//! tori, extrusions, revolutions, B-spline surfaces, and trimmed and offset
//! forms over those. All of the topology, with every occurrence's
//! orientation and placement, and edges carrying their curve, their pcurves
//! and their seams.
//!
//! ## What does not
//!
//! One thing the reader deliberately does *not* take on faith: whether an
//! edge's representations agree on parameterization. That is a claim, the
//! writing kernel's claim about its own data, and everything downstream
//! relies on it — so it is measured here instead, each representation
//! evaluated against the others at matched parameters and the claim
//! re-established only where they actually land together. A file can
//! therefore come back with the claim *established* where its writer never
//! made it, which is the right direction to be wrong in.
//!
//! Cached triangulations and the polygons that go with them are parsed and
//! skipped rather than half-honoured — this kernel tessellates on demand and
//! keeps its own cache, and a mesh read from a file would be a mesh nobody
//! could say the deflection of. The bookkeeping flags each record carries
//! are read and dropped for the same reason: they describe the state of the
//! writer's own session, not the shape.
